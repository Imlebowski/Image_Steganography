Steganography is hiding a message in another message.
This program hides a file into an image file(.bmp image) by encoding the file into LSbits of the source image file.
Since the encoding is done on the LSbits, only a very small change is made to the pixel data and the colour change is not visible.
While encoding the user can encrypt the message by giving a password.

On decoding only the option "d" and the encoded file name can be specified.


Running instructions:

1.Run the make file in the main folder
2.Run "stegno" with the arguments.
3.For encoding:
	<./stegno> -e <source.bmp> <secret_file> <output_file.bmp>
	Encrypt(Y/N) ?
	output_file.bmp will be created in current directory.
4.For decoding:
	<./stegno> -d <output_file.bmp>
	If encrypted
		Password :
	
	secret_file will be created in current directory.
